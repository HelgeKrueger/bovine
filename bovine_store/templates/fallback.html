    <h1>This object is not available as a web object</h1>

    Please search for <b>{{object_path}}</b> in your ActivityPub Client
    application.

    <p>
      <b>Example:</b> In the Mastodon web client this can be achieved by copying
      the url and pasting it into the search field at the top left.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Note</h3>
    Not providing a web view for all objects is due to:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wanting <a href="https://github.com/HelgeKrueger/bovine">Bovine</a> to
        implement some "privacy maximalist" opinion
      </li>
      <li>
        Thinking about how to properly displaying an arbitary ActivityStreams
        object gives me a headache, actually arbitrary json-ld objects. If you
        have a plan, please submit it as a
        <a href="https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/feps"
          >FEP</a
        >
        I will hopefully get around to implement it. Before making suggestions:
        Bovine flattens all json-ld objects before storage. Please take this
        into account for your proposal.

        If this disappoints you, have a Recipe, this might well be the element
        you were looking for.
